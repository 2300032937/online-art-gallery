Our mission is to create a hassle free way to purchase artwork, with no signup, no subscriptions, just you, your chosen artist and artwork.
With a drive to do better for the world, to create a fairer and kinder community, and to do our part to repair the world's climate, we give our 
artists the option to choose a charity that means something to them, as well as donating to Friends of the Earth, a charity that holds dear to all of us
here at MayflyOasis. Together we can create a world in which we all can be proud of, a world for positive change, a world that we all call home.
